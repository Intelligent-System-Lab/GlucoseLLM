This dataset comprises time series data of diabetes patient including glucose level readings along with various features such as insulin (basal and bolus) medisines and meal information. The glucose values are measured in mg/dL, other relevant features include insulin doses (referred as 'basal', 'TimePassedLastBasal', 'bolus', 'TimePassedLastBolus' features in our dataseet),
) and meal information (referred as 'MealCarbs' and 'TimePassedLastMeal' features in our dataset). The model needs to consider the complex interactions between glucose, basal insulin, bolus insulin, and food intake to make accurate predictions.
